This project predicts residential property prices using machine learning. It analyzes features like location, size, and number of bedrooms to estimate house prices accurately.

# Models Used:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree 
3. Random Forest 
4. Gradient Boosting 
5. XGBoost 

# Key Features:

-> Data preprocessing and visualization to identify price influencers

-> Comparison of multiple regression models for best performance

-> Evaluation using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² score

-> Interactive interface (CLI or Flask) to input property details and get predicted prices

# Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Flask (optional)

# Outcome:
Provides an accurate, easy-to-use tool for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions based on predicted house prices.
